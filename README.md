# Nike landing page

[Demo Page](https://wiktorw0.github.io/nike-landing-page/)

***Nike landing page is simple react project shown on [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) channel.***
</br>

***I choose to build this project to learn TailwindCSS. Before that i was experimenting with MUI. MUI is great library for React components but when it comes to customization sometimes is a tad annoying. That's why I wanted to try TailwindCSS to see if it would be easier here. Project was build using assets prepared by JavaScript Mastery.***
</br>
***I learned many new CSS tricks when it comes to scroll animations using Intersection Observer hook and general layout strategies. It was fun little project mainly focused on CSS properties and it is fully responsive. I added from my self set of animations and fully responive and animated hamburger menu.***
 
## ‚öíÔ∏è Built with:

- React 
- Tailwind CSS
